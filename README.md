# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Show-Analysis
This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows catalog. The project aims to uncover key insights from the dataset and demonstrate how to create an interactive dashboard in Excel.

The dashboard provides insights into content types, genres, ratings, and trends over time, helping stakeholders understand Netflix’s content distribution and growth.

### Key Highlights
Total Released: 3000
Count of Countries: 8
Total Genres: 8
Movies vs. TV Shows: 51% (Movies) vs. 49% (TV Shows)

### Insights and Observations
Overall Content Split

Netflix’s catalog is almost evenly split between Movies (51%) and TV Shows (49%). This near 50/50 ratio suggests Netflix invests in both formats to cater to diverse audience preferences.

### Trends of Genre by Years of Release

The line chart shows a significant increase in content releases over the last decade. After 2010, the number of titles added each year grew sharply, reflecting Netflix’s rapid expansion and content acquisition strategy.

### Genre Distribution

The top 8 genres include Action, Comedy, Documentary, Drama, Horror, Romance, Sci-Fi, and Thriller.
Drama tends to have the highest count across both Movies and TV Shows, followed by Comedy and Action.

### Rating by Type

Different ratings (e.g., TV-14, TV-MA, PG, PG-13, R, etc.) are distributed between Movies and TV Shows.
TV-14 and TV-MA appear frequently for TV Shows, whereas PG-13 and R ratings are more common among Movies.
Count of Rating

A separate bar chart breaks down how many titles fall into each rating category overall. This helps identify which content rating dominates Netflix’s library.
Distribution of Genres by Country and Type

### The dashboard shows how each country contributes to different genres for both Movies and TV Shows.
United State often leads in volume, but other countries (e.g., India, UK, Canada) also produce a substantial amount of content.
Slicers for Interactivity

### Genre Slicer: Quickly filter the entire dashboard by selecting one or more genres.
Additional slicers (if implemented) can filter by Year, Country, or Rating to drill down into specific segments.

Locate the Excel dashboard file (e.g., Netflix_Analysis_Dashboard.xlsx) in the cloned repository.
Open it in Microsoft Excel (2016 or later recommended for best compatibility).
Explore the Dashboard:

Click on Genre (or other) slicers to filter the data.
Observe how charts and key metrics update dynamically based on your selection.
Analyze & Draw Conclusions:

Compare different genres, years, and ratings.
Identify patterns such as the rise of TV shows, popularity of specific genres, or dominant ratings in certain countries.
